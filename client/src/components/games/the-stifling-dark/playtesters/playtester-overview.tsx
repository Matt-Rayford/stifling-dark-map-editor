			<h1>The Stifling Dark Playtesters</h1>
			<p>
				We owe a lot of thanks to our many great playtesters that have helped
				shape The Stifling Dark over the past few years. As a small token of
				gratitude, we want to acknowledge your contributions. Playtesters who
				were on our list at the beginning of May 2023 had their names included
				on an inside panel of the box bottom. While it's too late to add more
				names to the box, we will happily add anyone that was missed to our
				website!
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have playtested our game and want your name included on this
				page, please review the below list (sorted alphabetically by last name)
				and ensure your name is present. If your name is not present, please
				fill out the form at the end of the list and we will get your name
				added! Note that individuals who didn't provide their last name are
				listed at the end, so make sure you check that as well before submitting
				the form.
